    "## MAP Estimation Overview\n",
    "MAP estimation in regression involves incorporating a prior belief about the distribution of model parameters (in this case, the polynomial coefficients) and updating this belief based on the observed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For polynomial regression, if we assume a Gaussian prior for the coefficients, the MAP estimation modifies the objective function used in the regression to include a regularization term that reflects this prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components of MAP in Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Prior Distribution: You have a Gaussian prior on the polynomial coefficients 𝑤, typically expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$𝑝(𝑤∣𝛼)=𝑁(0,𝛼^{−1}𝐼)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $𝛼$ is the precision of the prior (not the variance). It reflects how strongly you believe the coefficients should be close to zero (larger 𝛼 implies stronger belief in smaller magnitude weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Likelihood Function: This is the likelihood of observing the data given the model parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, assuming Gaussian noise, the likelihood for a given set of parameters 𝑤 is also Gaussian centered around the model predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Posterior Distribution: MAP estimates the coefficients 𝑤 by maximizing the posterior distribution, which, due to Bayes' Rule, is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$𝑝(𝑤∣𝑡,𝑋,𝛼,𝛽)∝𝑝(𝑡∣𝑋,𝑤,𝛽)×𝑝(𝑤∣𝛼)p(w∣t,X,α,β)∝p(t∣X,w,β)×p(w∣α)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where 𝛽 is the precision of the likelihood (related to the noise variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Regularized Objective Function: In practical terms, maximizing the posterior is equivalent to minimizing a loss function that adds a regularization term to the usual sum of squared residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Minimize: ∣∣𝑋𝑤−𝑡∣∣^{2}+𝛼∣∣𝑤∣∣^{2}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "The regularization term $𝛼∣∣𝑤∣∣^{2}$ comes directly from the log of the Gaussian prior and penalizes large coefficients, effectively controlling overfitting."

    "Assume a Gaussian prior for the weights 𝑤 similar to MAP, \n",
    "\n",

    "Compute the posterior distribution over the weights, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w∣t,X,α,β)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $𝑚_{𝑁}$ and $S_{N}$ are updated based on the data and the priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Predictive Distribution: \n",
    "\n",
    "For new input $𝑥^{∗}$, the predictive distribution of the target $𝑡^{∗}$ is also Gaussian:\n",

    "$$𝑡^{∗}∣𝑥^{∗},𝑡,𝑋∼𝑁(𝑚_{𝑁}^{𝑇} 𝜙(x^{∗}),𝜎_{𝑁}^{2}(𝑥^{∗}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $𝜙(^{∗})$ are the polynomial features of $x^{∗}$ and $𝜎_{𝑁}^{2}(𝑥^{∗})$ includes the variance from the model uncertainty."
